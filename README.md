# Project for BME programming 3
Game of life with a swing GUI and customisable parameters

# Features
Manage square, hexagonal and triangular cells

Load and store custom configurations

Load and store snapshots of the field

Saved assets are stored under resources in the appropriate directory

# Instructions
UI is pretty self explanatory, make sure to hit "Load" after selecting a ruleset / sim as they are not loaded immediately upon selection

I plan to add a simple click-and-run version, until that the vscode launch config is available for ease of use
